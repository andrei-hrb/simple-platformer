# Simple Platformer

This is a retake of the game that the [Introducing JavaScript](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/introducing-javascript) - a TeamTreeHouse's introductory course helps you build. I took all of those assets, and made a whole new level adding lava, music and increased difficulty. 

I hope you will like it!
